# Excited Adiabatic State Preparation (EXASP)

This repository holds the code required to perform EXASP simulations, as
described in [INSERT PREPRINT HERE].
Relevant scripts and modules can be found in 
    ./exasp/
Example inputs and outputs can be found in 
    ./examples/


The different scripts and their functionality are as follows:
    1) ./exasp/exact_coupling.py
Compute 



## Pre-requisites

EXASP uses the Quantel library to perform HF calculations. This can be downloaded and installed from
    https://github.com/hgaburton/quantel
You may need to add the quantel source to the PYTHONPATH variable.

Also requires Qiskit software to perform quantum simulations. This can be downloaded and installed from
    pip install qiskit qiskit-nature qiskit-aer qiskit-ibm-runtime
