# exasp
Excited adiabatic state preparation

## Pre-requisites

EXASP uses the Quantel library to perform HF calculations. This can be downloaded and installed from
    https://github.com/hgaburton/quantel
You may need to add the quantel source to the PYTHONPATH variable.

Also requires Qiskit software to perform quantum simulations. This can be downloaded and installed from
    pip install qiskit qiskit-nature qiskit-aer qiskit-ibm-runtime
